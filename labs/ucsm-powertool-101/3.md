# Introduction to UCS PowerTool Part I Cisco DevNet Learning Labs

### Exercise 3
Launch UCS PowerTool, connect to a UCS Manager, query for various UCS objects, select multiple attributes and format the output. Then disconnect from the UCS Manager.

  1. Connect to the UCS Manager

  `Connect-Ucs -Name <ip-address-ucs-manager>`

  User: admin
  Password: password

  2. Query the blade compute resources and display the Dn, Total Memory, Number of CPUs and Serial Number.

  We viewed in the previous exercise that objects have multiple attributes. In the absence of any specific attributes being selected all the attributes and their values are displayed.  Using the PowerShell cmdlet `Select-Object` we were able to display the `Dn` attribute of the compute resource objects.

  To display more than a single attribute specify multiple attributes separated by commas after the `Select-Object` cmdlet. At the command prompt type

  `Get-UcsBlade | Select-Object Dn, TotalMemory, NumOfCpus, Serial`

  Get-UcsBlade with select attributes:

  ![](/posts/files/ucsm-powertool-101/assets/images/ucsm-powertool-101-12.jpg)

  3. Try the command again but this time add the SlotId attribute, at the command prompt type

  `Get-UcsBlade | Select-Object Dn, TotalMemory, NumOfCpus, Serial, SlotId`

  Get-UcsBlade with select attributes:

  ![](/posts/files/ucsm-powertool-101/assets/images/ucsm-powertool-101-13.jpg)

  Notice that the output format changed and there is no loner a table like listing. To force the table use the PowerShell cmdlet `Format-Table`, at the command prompt type

  `Get-UcsBlade | Select-Object Dn, TotalMemory, NumOfCpus, Serial, SlotId | Format-Table`

  Get-UcsBlade with Format-Table:

  ![](/posts/files/ucsm-powertool-101/assets/images/ucsm-powertool-101-14.jpg)

  Now the SlotId is displayed along with the other attributes in the table format.

  4. PowerShell also offers a graphical table output format called `Out-GridView`. Try the same command as before but instead of `Format-Table` lets use `Out-GridView` instead. At the command prompt type

  `Get-UcsBlade | Select-Object Dn, TotalMemory, NumOfCpus, Serial, SlotId | Out-GridView`

  Get-UcsBlade with Out-GridView:

  ![](/posts/files/ucsm-powertool-101/assets/images/ucsm-powertool-101-15.jpg)

  Out-GridView is really powerful, the column headings can be clicked to sort the values and criteria can be added to find specific output.

  5. In the Out-GridView window *click* on the ![](/posts/files/ucsm-powertool-101/assets/images/ucsm-powertool-101-19.jpg) button and *check* "NumOfCpus" and click "Add"

  ![](/posts/files/ucsm-powertool-101/assets/images/ucsm-powertool-101-16.jpg)

  On the resulting criteria line *click* the "is less than or equal to" link and select "equals" from the drop-down list.

  ![](/posts/files/ucsm-powertool-101/assets/images/ucsm-powertool-101-17.jpg)

  The resulting Out-GridView will show only compute blade resources that have "4" CPUs

  ![](/posts/files/ucsm-powertool-101/assets/images/ucsm-powertool-101-18.jpg)

  What you will experience with PowerTool and PowerShell is that there are many ways to do the same thing.  We could have specified the `-NumOfCpus` parameter with the `Get-UcsBlade` cmdlet

  `Get-UcsBlade -NumOfCpus 4 | Select-Object Dn, TotalMemory, NumOfCpus, Serial, SlotId | Format-Table`

  Or we could have piped the output of `Get-UcsBlade` to the PowerShell `Where-Object` cmdlet

  `Get-UcsBlade | Where-Object {$_.NumOfCpus -eq 4} | Select-Object Dn, TotalMemory, NumOfCpus, Serial, SlotId | Format-Table`

  Try those commands and view the output.

  8. Disconnect from UCS Manager, at the command prompt type

  `Disconnect-Ucs`

Several PowerShell commands have aliases and while you are exploring UCS PowerTool and writing PowerShell scripts you will come across them when searching for code examples.

* Format-Table has the alias "ft"
* Out-GridView has the alias "ogv"
* Select-Object has the alias "Select"
* Where-Object has the alias "?"
* ForEach-Object has the alias "%" <-- we have not covered this one yet.

This is the end of exercise 3.
