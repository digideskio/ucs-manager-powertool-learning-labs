# Introduction to UCS Python SDK Part I Cisco DevNet Learning Labs

### Exercise 1e - Connecting / Disconnecting from UCS Manager:

  In this next example, we will use the UcsHandle class (from the ucshandle module) to connect to a UCS Domain.   The UCS Platform Emulator (UCSPE)  will access ANY login credentials.

  Run the following commands to authenticate against the UCS Manager XML API, and establish a session.

  -	Note:  the <strong>class or function name</strong> (derived from help) needs to be specified and is <strong>case sensitive</strong>

  ```Python
	handle = UcsHandle("10.0.254.12", "admin", "passsword")
	handle.login()
  ```

  Use the vars() function to view the new handle object, and view the various properties and attributes of this class.  

  -	This will display all the UCSM Session information (UCS Domain name, user privileges, session cookie, cookie refresh period):

	`vars(handle)`

### Exercise 1f - Launch the UCS Manager Java GUI

  Next we will login back into a UCS Domain, and launch the UCS Manager JAVA GUI (via http)

  ```Python
  handle = UcsHandle("10.0.254.12","admin","passsword",secure=False)
	handle.login()
  ```

  In order to launch the UCSM Java GUI, we will be using the function "ucs_gui_launch" defined in the module "ucsguilaunch", which is located in this folder:  ucsmsdk\utils directory, specified as follows:

  ```Python
  from ucsmsdk.utils.ucsguilaunch import ucs_gui_launch
	ucs_gui_launch(handle)
  ```

  The UCS Manager Java file will download and launch in the local Java client:

### Exercise 1g - Using convert_to_ucs_python() to discover Python Code

  Next we will use a special function: convert_to_ucs_python(), which has the ability to listen to the UCSM JAVA GUI logfile, identify configuration changes and convert these to their Python Equivalent.

  -	A powerful, simple to use tool for discovering Python automation code.
  -	This function is contained in the "converttopython" module, located in the "utils" directory:

  ```python
  from ucsmsdk.utils.converttopython import convert_to_ucs_python
	convert_to_ucs_python()
  ```

  ![](/posts/files/ucsm-python-sdk-101/assets/images/ucsm-python-sdk-101-12.png)

  Notice how the local UCSM Java GUI log file is identified above (centrale_xxxx.log)

  -	This log file will now be monitored for any configuration created/saved via the UCSM Java GUI.
  -	This function will run continuously, until a "control+c" is executed to break back to the shell.

### Exercise 1h - Create a VLAN in the GUI; discover the Python code equivalent

  In the UCSM Java GUI

  1. Navigate to the LAN Tab
  2. *Right-click* on VLANs (under LAN Cloud)
  3. *Click* "Create VLANs"
  4. Name the VLAN "vlan10"
  5. Set the VLAN ID to 5

  ![](/posts/files/ucsm-python-sdk-101/assets/images/ucsm-python-sdk-101-13.png)

  Notice that after the VLAN is created, the Python shell displays the Python Code needed to repeat this same task. This provides a powerful method of discovering Python code to automate (anything) in UCS!

  Note:  this output will be used in the next lab.

This concludes the lab ucsm-python-sdk-101
